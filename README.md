## 🔄 **Advanced Convergence Cycle System**

The **Convergence Cycle Engine** provides litigation-grade iterative builds with full traceability:

### **Output Contract (Every Cycle)**

1. **Increment VERSION** (v0001 → v0002 → v0003...)
2. **Update CURRENT** (always points to runnable latest version)
3. **Snapshot VERSIONS/vNNNN** (immutable archive of each version)
4. **Update CHANGELOG + MANIFEST** (complete change tracking)
5. **Run smoke tests** and capture logs
6. **Build FULL release zip** (if >2 files change or multi-module feature added)
7. **Enforce size policy**:
   - Exclude large binaries/weights/media
   - Use PATCHES mode if projected >650MB
   - Report size budget when growth >50MB

### **Running the Convergence Cycle**

```bash
# Run full convergence cycle
python convergence_cycle_engine.py

# Or use the CLI wrapper
python run_cycle.py

# Check current status
python run_cycle.py --status

# View version history
python run_cycle.py --history

# Create snapshot without full cycle
python run_cycle.py --snapshot
```

### **Version Management**

- **VERSION**: Current version number (e.g., `v0042`)
- **CURRENT**: Pointer to latest runnable version
- **VERSIONS/vNNNN/**: Immutable snapshots of each build
  - Complete source code snapshot
  - `SNAPSHOT_MANIFEST.json` with file listing and metadata
  
### **Build Artifacts**

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Complete change history in Keep a Changelog format
- **codex_manifest.json**: SHA-256 hashes of all modules
- **logs/convergence_cycle.log**: Full cycle execution log
- **logs/smoke_tests.log**: Test results with timestamps
- **logs/size_report.log**: Size policy compliance reports
- **output/SUPREME_LITIGATION_OS_vNNNN_TIMESTAMP.zip**: Full release packages

### **Size Policy Enforcement**

The system automatically:
- Excludes large files (>10MB) from releases
- Switches to PATCHES mode for projects >650MB
- Reports size growth warnings when changes >50MB
- Maintains size budget history

### **Smoke Tests**

Each cycle runs:
1. Core module import tests
2. Manifest integrity verification
3. Critical file existence checks
4. Full pytest suite (if available)

## ⚖️ **Zero-Drift, Zero-Placeholder Pledge**

> **This repository is governed by the FRED PRIME mainframe.**
> All scripts, documents, and outputs are:
>
> * **Placeholder-free** (no TODOs, no approximations)
> * **Truncation-immune** (never silent failure)
> * **Chain-of-custody and SHA-256 hash locked**
> * **Litigation, evidentiary, and court admissible**
> * **Every log and manifest is human- and machine-readable**

**If a script cannot finish, it fails safely and logs the reason—never leaving your evidence in doubt.**

---

## 🚀 **Installation & Environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

* **Requires Python 3.8+**
* Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac; PowerShell script is Windows only)
* **No additional dependencies except those in requirements.txt**

---

## 🏛️ **Usage**

### **Main System (Manifest Build)**

```bash
python build_system.py
```

* Builds/updates the `fredprime_litigation_system.json` manifest with all active modules, versions, and configuration.
* Can be run standalone or via GUI.

---

### **Organize Drive Utility**

#### **Python:**

```bash
python organize_drive.py F:/
```

* Scans target drive/folder, sorts by file type/category into `/Organized/`, removes empty folders, logs every move.
* Handles collisions with automatic renaming.
* Log file: `organize_drive.log`

#### **PowerShell:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\organize_drive.ps1 -Path F:\
```

* Additional params: `-Output` for custom output dir, `-Log` for log location.

---

### **GUI / MBP Launcher (if present)**

* Launch the MBP GUI (`python gui/gui_launcher.py` if included) for click-to-run access to all tools, logs, manifests, and timelines.

---

## 🗂️ **Forensic, Timeline, and Compliance Tools**

* **All intake, sort, OCR, tag, manifest, and audit logs** are hash-protected and ready for use in court or as chain-of-custody proof.
* **`audit_chain.log`** is machine- and human-readable for use in evidence hearings or FOIA/Rule 11 defense.
* **Timeline generation** (`timeline.json` or via EPOCH engine) visualizes all events—see the [Visual System Map](#visual-system-map).

---

## 🔒 **Legal Safety, Chain-of-Custody, and Evidence Integrity**

* **Files are never silently deleted.**
* **All movements are logged, collisions handled, and logs are preserved.**
* **SHA-256 hashes are generated for key files; logs are never modified after creation (immutable).**
* **System will halt and alert the user in case of any chain-of-custody violation, evidence loss, or hash mismatch.**
* **Every action can be reversed or replayed using logs.**

---

## 🛡️ **Forensic Validation & Compliance**

**How to produce a hash manifest and prove evidence integrity:**

```bash
python build_system.py --audit
# Produces audit_chain.log and manifest with hashes
```

**To show audit trail in court:**

* Present `audit_chain.log`, `fredprime_litigation_system.json`, and the log from your organize/OCR steps.
* Hashes are printable and verifiable with any SHA-256 tool (Python, Linux, Windows certutil).

**FOIA/Discovery**

* `FOIA_discovery_request.txt` is generated for any unverified or missing evidence.

---

## 🔥 **Example Litigation Workflow**

**From raw drive to court-ready, hash-locked exhibit binder in 15 minutes:**

1. **Run organize\_drive.py** on F:/ or evidence folder
2. **OCR/tag exhibits** with `EPOCH_UNPACKER_ENGINE_v1.py`
3. **Build system manifest** with `build_system.py`
4. **Run audit** to create immutable logs
5. **Generate FOIA/discovery requests** if needed
6. **Export/print logs** for binder or submission

---

## ⚡ **Trigger Words / Power Commands**

* `python build_system.py --audit`
* `python organize_drive.py --dry-run`
* `"Build Canon Report"` (GUI)
* `"Generate Timeline Warboard"` (GUI/CLI)
* `"Export Litigation Binder"` (GUI/CLI)
* `"Simulate Judicial Response"` (GUI/CLI)

---

## 🧠 **Integration with MBP and Litigation OS**

* **FRED PRIME is modular.**
  Register new scripts in `fredprime_litigation_system.json` or plug into any MBP GUI mainframe.
* **Plug-in ready:**
  Just point to your new modules in the manifest for instant inclusion.

## 👩‍⚖️ **FAQ & Troubleshooting**

**Q: What if a file fails hash check?**
A: The system will flag it in `audit_chain.log` and halt further processing until reviewed. Restore from backup or log for court/FOIA challenge.

**Q: How do I prove evidence chain in court?**
A: Present `audit_chain.log`, `fredprime_litigation_system.json`, and original logs. All are SHA-256 protected.

**Q: What if a judge/FOIA officer challenges authenticity?**
A: All logs and manifests are self-authenticating. Compare hashes and event logs with any standard tool.

**Q: Can I use this for federal, state, and local litigation?**
A: Yes—designed for full MCR, MCL, FOIA, and federal compliance.

## 🔄 **Continuous Integration**

The `Codex Build` workflow automatically runs on pushes or pull requests to `main` or any `codex/*` branch. It installs dependencies, lints with `black`, `mypy`, and `flake8`, and runs `pytest` whenever relevant source files change or the branch name includes keywords like `core`, `engine`, `matrix`, `echelon`, `patch`, or `hotfix`.
