# FRED PRIME Litigation Utilities

This repository provides simple Python scripts for managing litigation documents. The tools here allow you to:

- **Auto-label exhibits** in a folder (`Exhibit_A`, `Exhibit_B`, ...)
- **Link motions to exhibits** by scanning motion text files
- **Validate signature blocks** according to Michigan Court Rule 1.109(D)(3)

These scripts are intentionally lightweight and run entirely offline. They only operate on files you provide and produce markdown summaries for easy review.
Because labeling will rename your files, consider working on copies or using version control to undo changes.

## Setup

You need Python 3.8 or newer. Clone the repo and install dependencies (only the standard library is used):

```bash
python3 fredprime.py --help
```

## Usage

### Label exhibits
Rename all files in a directory sequentially and create `Exhibit_Index.md`:

```bash
python3 fredprime.py label-exhibits path/to/exhibits
```

### Link motions to exhibits
Scan all `.txt` files in a directory for references like `Exhibit A` and build `Motion_to_Exhibit_Map.md`:

```bash
python3 fredprime.py link-motions path/to/motions
```

### Validate a signature block
Check that a document contains a line beginning with `s/` followed by a name:

```bash
python3 fredprime.py validate-signature path/to/document.txt
```

## Repository Contents

- `fredprime.py` – command‑line entry point
- `src/` – module implementations
  - `exhibit_labeler.py`
  - `motion_exhibit_linker.py`
  - `signature_validator.py`

These utilities are minimal examples and may be extended as needed.
